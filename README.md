# 1. Project Objective

The objective of this project was to build a real-time, data-driven Web Marketing Dashboard that gives full visibility into how the website performs across traffic, content, regions, and devices. The dashboard acts as a decision-support tool for digital marketing and analytics teams, helping them track engagement, identify trends, and optimise content based on evidence rather than guesswork.

# 2. What I Did (Project Overview & Work Completed)

I transformed raw web analytics data into a clean, interactive Power BI dashboard that helps stakeholders quickly understand website performance. My work covered end-to-end development, including data preparation, modelling, and visualisation design.

## Key tasks completed

● Processed and analysed 418,000+ sessions and 625,000+ unique pageviews to uncover behavioural patterns.
● Segmented bounce rate by device types to identify mobile vs desktop engagement gaps.
● Built visual breakdowns for top five pages by traffic across countries and devices, revealing content strengths and weaknesses.
● Designed time-series visuals to track performance trends and spikes caused by campaigns or organic changes.
● Created a traffic source analysis to quantify the contribution of organic, direct, referral, and paid channels.
● Applied UX-focused visual principles to ensure the dashboard could be used by non-technical teams with minimal guidance.

# 3. Why I Did It (Purpose & Value)

Digital marketing teams struggle to monitor website performance when data is scattered or overly technical. This dashboard centralises key marketing metrics and provides clarity in a single view.

The purpose was to:
● Make website performance measurable and easy to interpret
● Provide real-time insights to support faster marketing decisions
● Identify what content attracts the most engagement
● Highlight device, regional, and page-level trends that influence digital strategy
● Simplify reporting for stakeholders who are not familiar with analytics tools

# 4. Methodology & Tools Used

● Power BI for visualisation and dashboard development
● Power Query for cleaning, transforming, and preparing analytics data into structured tables
● DAX measures for calculating bounce rate, engagement metrics, and performance ratios
● Visual design principles focusing on clean layouts, intuitive grouping, and colour cues to reduce cognitive load

# 5. Business Impact

The dashboard provides measurable business benefits:

● Identified high-performing pages that drive the majority of the 418k+ sessions, enabling content teams to replicate successful formats.
● Revealed underperforming pages with higher bounce rates, helping shape optimisation priorities.
● Exposed device and country-level trends, supporting targeted marketing and better user experience design.
● Helped the team respond faster to performance dips by visualising week-on-week changes.
● Improved communication of insights to non-technical staff through simple, intuitive visuals, reducing reporting time.

# 6. Key Learnings

● Strengthened skills in transforming raw marketing data into meaningful business insights.
● Learned to apply UX/UI principles to data storytelling for easier interpretation.
● Gained hands-on experience in designing dashboards for real-world decision-making contexts.
● Improved understanding of how web analytics translate into digital strategy and content optimisation.

# Improvement Suggestions

● Integrate automatic data refresh to enable near real-time monitoring without manual updates.
● Add conversion tracking metrics such as form submissions, leads generated, or CTA engagement to link traffic to business outcomes.
● Incorporate user journey paths to visualise navigation patterns and identify drop-off points.
● Perform A/B comparison visuals to evaluate the impact of campaigns, banners, and design changes.
● Include SEO metrics such as impressions, clicks, and average position by connecting Google Search Console data.
● Add anomaly detection using DAX logic to highlight sudden performance spikes or drops automatically.
